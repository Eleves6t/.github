Eleves6t was formerly an unofficial organization of students of the [Gymnase 
de La Cité](https://www.gymnasecite.ch/) whose goal was mainly to spread 
information among the students about student-driven projects or events, in 
particular with Eleves6t's website, which is not available anymore.

Just like the [Podcast de La Cité](https://github.com/PodcastDeLaCite), 
Eleves6t stopped existing when the students composing it graduated, with no 
one to take their place.
